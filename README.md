# Introduction
This post is about me and why I started this blog
1. My full name is Tran Anh Quan living in Hanoi, Vietnam and I was born in 2004.
2. The reason I am writing this blog is to give my thoughts and feelings about programming and my posting frequency will be about once a week. I chose this topic for blogging because simply coding is my hobby. In particular, I feel excited every time I find the optimal solution for a certain problem. It could be faster, take less memory, or be simpler than my original way.
